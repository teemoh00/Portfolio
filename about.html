      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I'm Timothy Mutisya, a multi-disciplinary creative and tech enthusiast with a degree in Applied Statistics.
        My journey started with a love for numbers, data, and problem-solving — but quickly grew into a broader passion
        for building and designing digital solutions that make a difference.</p>
      <p>I specialize in web development, graphic design, video editing, and data analysis, offering a unique blend of
        analytical precision and creative storytelling.
        Whether it's developing responsive websites, designing eye-catching visuals, editing engaging videos, or
        extracting insights from data, I bring both logic and creativity to every project.</p>
      <p>At Visuals Creatives, we believe in the power of collaboration. We work closely with our clients to understand
        their vision and bring it to reality. Our goal is to create visually appealing and effective solutions that
        resonate with your audience.</p>
      <p>Currently based in Nairobi and open to remote or on-site opportunities, I’m focused on helping brands and
        individuals bring their visions to life through smart design, powerful code, and meaningful data.
        I'm always learning, building, and ready to collaborate on exciting new challenges.</p>

    <h2>My Background Story</h2>
    <p>I am a passionate and multi-skilled creative with a egree in Applied Statistics and a strong foundation in data
      analysis, web development, graphic design, and video editing.
      My academic background has equipped me with analytical thinking, precision, and problem-solving skills, which I
      apply across both technical and creative projects.
      I thrive in dynamic environments where I can transform data into actionable insights, design compelling visual
      content, and build functional digital platforms.</p>
    <p>My professional journey began with a 6-month experience as an Office Administrator Assistant at the County
      Government of Makueni, where I gained hands-on exposure to administrative operations, data entry, and customer
      service.
      This role sharpened my organizational and communication skills, while giving me a deeper understanding of public
      service and operational coordination.
      Since then, I have continued to expand my capabilities by working on personal projects that blend statistical
      knowledge with digital creativity.</p>
    <p>Driven by curiosity and a desire to create impact, I have developed and designed a personal portfolio website —
      Visuals Creatives — to showcase my projects in data analysis, web and graphic design, and video editing.
      I am actively seeking both online and physical opportunities where I can contribute meaningfully, grow
      professionally, and gain financial independence.
      With a commitment to continuous learning and a versatile skill set, I am ready to take on new challenges and
      deliver value in any role I pursue.</p>
    <p>At Visuals Creatives, we are more than just a design agency; we are storytellers, innovators, and problem
      solvers. Our background story is one of passion, dedication, and a relentless pursuit of excellence in everything
      we do.</p>
